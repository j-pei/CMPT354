## About this course

As a data scientist, what should you do when you are facing a huge amount of complicated data from real life applications? This course introduces the core techniques in big data analytics, namely knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), also known as data mining (DM). It focuses on the principles, essential ideas, fundamental algorithms, implementations, and applications.

# Prerequisites

- Comprehensive understanding and fluent skills in data structures, such as linked data structures, B-trees, and hash functions.
- Analysis of algorithms and time complexity.
- Operating systems, main memory and disk management, file systems.
- Elementary probability theory and statistics, such as random variables, distributions, probability mass functions, sampling, and statistical tests.

# Textbook and references
- (Official textbook) Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques (3rd ed.), Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber, and Jian Pei, Morgan Kaufmann, 2011.
- Drafts of some chapters in the 4th ed. will be available for interested students.

# Format and Zoom link
- Classes and office hours through zoom [CMPT 459 Zoom](https://sfu.zoom.us/j/67922370112?pwd=TnZzY0FzdERseVMyWnNkMFJZbGc3dz09). 
- A combination of online classes and recorded lectures.  Students are required to attend the classes. See the schedule section for details.
- In-class exams.
